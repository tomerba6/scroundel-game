# Scoundrel — UI Layer (plain version)

This documents the Scene2D UI as it exists today: the decisions locked in the
design interview, the visual tokens, the architecture, and every component on
screen. It complements [`design.md`](design.md) (the rules engine); keep both
in sync with the code.

> **This is not the final look.** The current UI is the deliberate *plain*
> version: flat color tiles, drawn suit shapes, text everywhere. Card art,
> sprites, and animations are a later pass — the layout, theme seams, and
> interaction model below were built so that pass swaps assets and adds motion
> without rewriting screen logic.

## Locked decisions (from the design interview)

- **Layout: room-centered.** The four room cards dominate the center; thin HUD
  strips top and bottom. No sidebar.
- **Cards: typed tiles.** Role-colored (monster/weapon/potion), big value,
  small rank + suit index in the corner.
- **Input: press-then-pick.** A card with one legal move plays immediately; a
  monster with both fight options pops a small two-button chooser at the card.
  Avoid is a HUD button.
- **Cards, chooser buttons, and the animation gate act on _press_, not click**
  (`Widgets.pressListener`). Scene2D's `ClickListener` only fires when the
  release lands back on the same actor, so fast play — where the mouse is
  already travelling to the next card as the button comes up — silently lost
  clicks. Real buttons (Avoid, New game, Records) keep release semantics, so a
  press can still be cancelled by sliding off.
- **Event log: fading feed.** The last few events float top-right and fade;
  no permanent log panel.
- **Flow (revised 2026-07-07):** launch lands on a tiny **title screen** —
  the navigation anchor every future menu (achievements, variants) hangs off:
  New game / Records / a dim credit line. Win/loss dims the board under an
  overlay with the score, best line, New game, and Records. **Records is
  reachable only between games** (title + end overlay): a run, once started,
  is uninterruptible — consistent with quit-outs being unrecorded.
- **Window:** resizable, 1280×720 default, Fit viewport (letterboxed scaling).
- **Mood: torchlit dungeon** — dark, warm, quiet.

## Design tokens

Palette (all constants in `screens.Theme`):

| Token | Hex | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| soot | `#17130f` | background |
| stone | `#241d16` | frames, strips, popups |
| dried blood | `#8c2f22` | monster tiles, slain chips, DEFEATED |
| iron | `#7a8794` | weapon tiles |
| herbal | `#5d8a4a` | potion tiles |
| torchlight | `#d9a441` | accent: Avoid, threshold plate, ticker, CLEARED |
| bone | `#e8ddc7` | text, health |

Type (generated at startup via `gdx-freetype` from TTFs in `assets/fonts/`,
both SIL OFL, licenses bundled):

- **IM Fell English** — display (64px card values, 42px overlay titles). Its
  old-style numerals are a deliberate period touch (a big "11" reads a little
  like Roman "II"; the corner index always shows the true identity in the sans
  face).
- **Alegreya Sans** regular/bold — HUD labels, buttons, feed, corner indices
  (18px and 14px).

Neither face has suit glyphs, so ♠♥♦♣ are drawn as pixmap shapes in `Theme`
and tinted at use; feed copy writes names out ("the Queen of clubs").

## Architecture

- **View = f(state), rebuilt wholesale.** `GameScreen` holds the immutable
  `GameState`; every move runs `apply`, replaces the state, and rebuilds the
  whole widget tree from it. No incremental widget updates — if the state is
  right, the screen is right. Motion never weakens this: the `Choreographer`
  (below) plays cosmetic flights *over* rebuilds, so widget identity across
  moves is never needed.
- **Choreographer: cosmetic motion over the final board.** After a move the
  board is rebuilt first (truth before motion), then flight proxies — built by
  the same `CardTiles` factory as the real tiles, which hide meanwhile —
  replay the transition above it: dealt cards fly out of the depth ticker
  (the dungeon made physical), the carryover card slides from its old slot,
  and an avoided room sweeps up into the ticker before the next deal.
  Animations are **blocking but skippable, and no click is ever wasted**: a
  fullscreen gate holds input while one plays, and a press on it settles the
  board *and* resolves the card it landed on (`Choreographer.SkipListener` →
  `GameScreen.resolveCardAt`). Always safe, because nothing mid-flight carries
  game state. Durations, stagger, and card size are `Theme` tokens, kept short
  on purpose — the gate covers the whole deal, so a long animation reads as
  dropped clicks (`Motion.dealWindow` pins that span: 0.30s deal, 0.50s after
  an avoid). The pure parts — the window arithmetic and the "which card is
  under this point" lookup — live in `Motion` and `CardHitRegions` so they are
  unit tested headlessly. Locked motion set, both shipped:
  traveling cards (deal-in + avoid sweep) and feedback pulses (damage
  shudders the HP bar and flashes the number dried blood; healing glows the
  fill back in, herbal). No reveals or ambient effects yet.
- **Navigation.** `ScoundrelGame` is the navigator: it owns the shared
  `Theme` and `RunLog`, exposes `showTitle`/`showGame`/`showRecords`, and
  disposes the outgoing screen on every switch. Screens are cheap and built
  fresh each time; nothing is cached across switches.
- **Dumb view.** The screen calls only `newGame` / `legalMoves` / `apply`.
  Everything conditional (Avoid enabled, instant-play vs chooser, chooser
  contents) derives from `legalMoves`. Zero rule logic in screens — even
  damage previews were omitted rather than duplicate combat math in the UI.
- **`Theme` owns every visual fact**: palette, fonts, flat drawables (a 1×1
  white texture tinted per use), suit icons. Created once in `ScoundrelGame`,
  disposed once, passed to screens. The sprite pass swaps Theme internals.
- **Programmatic styles, no uiskin.** With zero art, the Scene2D `Skin`
  JSON/atlas adds indirection; styles are built in code, compiler-checked.
  (The unused liftoff `assets/ui/` skin remains and should be removed or
  replaced in the art pass.) An atlas-backed Skin becomes worthwhile when
  real textures arrive.
- **`FitViewport` at a fixed 1280×720 virtual resolution** — all layout math
  in one coordinate system, any window size letterboxes. Fonts are generated
  once at design sizes.
- **Three stage layers with distinct lifetimes:** the root board table
  (cleared per rebuild), the feed anchor (persistent, `Touchable.disabled` so
  it never steals clicks), and transient overlays (chooser, end screen) on
  top. The end overlay is modal by construction — fill-parent with a
  background swallows input to the dead board.
- **Events feed the feed; state feeds everything else.** `MoveResult.events`
  are consumed once for feed lines; persistent widgets render from state.
  `RoomDealt` and `GameWon/Lost` are filtered (board and overlay own those
  facts). The feed is the first real consumer of the observer seam that
  achievements/stats will use.
- **Run recording.** `ScoundrelGame` builds a `RunLog` (`~/.scoundrel/runs.log`)
  and hands it to the screen. Each game gets a `RunRecorder` seeded with the
  shuffle seed; `applyMove` feeds it every `MoveResult`, and the finished run
  is appended before the end overlay shows. A storage failure is logged and
  never interrupts play.

## Components on screen

- **Top strip** — `HP` label, the charring health bar (bone fill lerping to
  dried blood as health drops), health number; the **depth ticker** (one tick
  per card of the deck, torchlight = still face-down, dark = gone; avoided
  rooms visibly return ticks) with a `depth: N cards` caption; the **Avoid**
  button (torchlight when legal, stone when not).
- **Room row** — up to four typed tiles: type label, display-font value,
  rank + suit index bottom-right. Weapon tiles use soot text on iron for
  contrast; monster/potion tiles use bone.
- **Chooser** — stone popup over the clicked card with one torchlight button
  per legal move ("Use weapon" / "Barehanded"); clicking anywhere else
  dismisses. Generic: a future card offering three moves gets three buttons.
- **Trophy rail** (bottom-left) — equipped weapon mini-tile, slain-monster
  chips in kill order, and the threshold plate: `slays anything` (fresh),
  `slays < N`, or `spent` (slew a 2). Reads `Barehanded` when nothing is
  equipped.
- **Potion marker** (bottom-right) — `potion ready` (dim) or
  `• potion used this turn` (torchlight).
- **Fading feed** (top-right) — up to four lines, fading after ~4s:
  "Slew the Queen of clubs — took 6", "Fought … barehanded — took 12",
  "Drank the 7 of hearts — healed 5" / "— already full",
  "… wasted — one potion a turn", "Equipped the 5 of diamonds",
  "The weapon dulls — slays < 6" / "The weapon is spent",
  "Avoided the room".
- **End overlay** — dim soot over the board; `DUNGEON CLEARED` (torchlight)
  or `DEFEATED` (dried blood), the score in display type, a best-score line
  (`New best!` in torchlight, or `best N` dimmed — from the persisted run
  history), **New game** (reshuffles in place), and **Records**.
- **Title screen** — `SCOUNDREL` in display type over soot, New game and
  Records buttons, and a dim designer-credit line. Deliberately empty
  otherwise; future menus join the button column.
- **THE LEDGER (records screen)** — the top 10 runs as a dungeon ledger:
  Roman-numeral ranks in torchlight, scores in IM Fell (dried blood when
  negative), outcome, date, duration, monsters slain, hairline rules between
  rows. Beside it, lifetime totals headed `ACROSS N FINISHED RUNS` (the
  label encodes the quit-runs decision: finished games are the whole
  universe). Empty state invites a first run; Back returns to the title.

## What the art pass will change (and what it won't)

Later work — card art and sprites inside the existing tile frames and
ambient atmosphere — lands mostly in `Theme` and the existing
`Choreographer`. What should *not* change: the
dumb-view rule, the state-rebuild model as the source of truth, the
legalMoves-driven interaction, and the event-stream feed. If an animation
needs to know a rule, that's a sign the engine should expose it, not the UI
re-derive it.
